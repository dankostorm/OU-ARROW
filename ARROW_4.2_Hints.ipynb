    "This notebook contains hints, tips and code snippets that you might find useful in completing Activity 4.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, many activities like this will require the same workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in some data.\n",
    "2. Process the data.\n",
    "3. Optionally, Display the data.\n",
    "4. Write out the data - usually to a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIONAL: For those of you more confident in Python coding, you could put all the activities in a loop, provide the program with a list of all your spectrum file names and process all of them at the same time. If you do attempt this, don't use Matplotlib to display anything, use Bokeh. For a number of technical reasons, Matplotlib doesn't display multiple, sequential plots well in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "GENERAL HINT: You'll need to read in the spectrum header lines (there's 12 of them - all starting with '#') using ordinary Python File IO. Later you'll use ordinary FileIO to write these to a new file then APPEND the modified pandas Dataframe to this as comma delimited data. (use pandas .to_csv() with \"mode='a'). You'll want this information preserved for future use in the Topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Read in, process and write out the main spectral data using Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: You can display the spectrum using either Matplotlib or Bokeh. Matplotlib is superficially easier but Bokeh will be more useful later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Review the 'Pandas' and 'Bokeh' notebooks which you first used in Week 1\n"
